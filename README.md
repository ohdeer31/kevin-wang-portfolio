![alt text](./assets/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-29%20at%2010.14.42%20PM.png)

- Using the skill and knowledge learned from the bootcamp, creating my very own portfolio setup for the future job interview use.
- Doing this project helps testing my knowledge and improve my skill set. 
- By actually working on codes helps me getting a better understanding on how position, flex-wrap, flex-direction, etc. work.
- It is important to learn where you can find the resources. Beside getting information through classes, googling is probably the best idea.
